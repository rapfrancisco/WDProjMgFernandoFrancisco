            <h2> What We Offer </h2>
            <p>
                Oricentric is a website developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to highlight the 
                beauty of Origami, both as a calming art and a catalyst for innovation in science.

            <p> 
                We showcase informative content on Origami’s history, role in modern science (with NASA’s starshade), and different folds
                such as valley, mountain and squash fold–all used to create different Origami works. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Our mission is to explain concepts on Origami’s history, mechanisms, and real-world applications, as well as 
                showcasing origami as a visual form of art through our works. We hope users may learn to appreciate the 
                deep cultural roots of origami, the art of folding paper, the influence of origami on technology, and ultimately
                be inspired to learn and create their own origami pieces.
