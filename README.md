## Brief Description


**Oricentric** is a website developed in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, aiming to **highlight the beauty of Origami**, both as a calming art and a catalyst for innovation in science. We showcase informative content on Origami’s **history**, role in modern **science** (with NASA’s starshade), and **different folds** such as valley, mountain and squash fold–all used to create different Origami works. We additionally offer a clean and user-friendly interface, and engaging visuals.


As an educational and creative website for **students**, **art enthusiasts**, **STEM, and engineering learners**, we aim to explain concepts on Origami’s history, mechanisms, and real-world applications, as well as showcasing origami as a visual form of art through our works. We hope users may learn to **appreciate** the deep cultural roots of origami, and the art of folding paper, as well as **understand** the influence of origami on technology.
